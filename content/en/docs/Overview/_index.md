You are here in the documentation section, where we provide detailed ressources and information on most medical aspects of gender transitions.

All information is sourced from **scientific literature**. We write a warning in case an info is only experimental or hypothetical.

**We are a small team of volunteer working on our free time; for this reason, source references are not present everywhere yet. We will update sources regularly and as soon as possible.**

If you are not acquainted with the general science behind hormone therapy, we advise you to start with the **"Basic science"** folder, and read it in the proposed order, since the information builds up on each previous page.
