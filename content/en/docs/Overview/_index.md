TransHub is the information and action platform of TFSF, a grass-root, volunteer-run initiative, working with therapeutic education and harm reduction, in the framework of medical transitions. 

You are here in the information section, where we provide detailed information on most medical aspects of gender transitions.

If you are not acquainted with the general science behind hormone therapy, we advise you to start with the "Basic science" folder, and read it in the proposed order, since the information builds up on each previous page.
