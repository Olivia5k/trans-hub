## Intramuscular injection ##

An intramuscular injection delivers medication deep into the muscle tissue. Being highly vascularized, the medication is absorbed quickly into the bloodstream.

IM are given at a **90° angle** - that is, straight through the skin and fat layer, into the muscle.
Needles are typically **20-23G, and 1-1.5 inch long**. Take into consideration the layer of fat - if you are a bigger person, and depending on the site of injection, you might need to take a slightly longer needle.

### 1 - SETTING UP ###

- Clean your work area and assemble supply:
  - Medication in the vial
  - The syringes and two needles: one for drawing (18G), and one for injecting (20-23G; 1-1.5 inch)
  - Alcohol swab
  - Sharps container for disposal

- Check the medication: expiry date, visible particles, discoloration… 
- Check the syringe package: do not use it if it is opened or damaged.
- Wash your hands thoroughly.

### 2 - PREPARING THE DOSE ###

- Clean the rubber stopper with the alcohol swab, and leave it untouched to dry.
- Attach the 18G needle to the syringe, and remove the cover.
- Draw air in the syringe, as much as the amount of medication you will inject.
- Insert the needle through the center of the rubber stop into the bottle (vial is up, needle down), and inject the air into the bottle. This will create pressure that will help with drawing.
- Turn the vial upside down, keeping the needing in the vial. Make sure the liquid covers the tip of the needle.
- Slowly pull the plunger to fill the syringe with the medication, to a bit more than what you will inject.
- Check for air bubbles, and tap with your fingers to have them go up the syringe. Slowly push the plunger to remove them, and reach the exact amount of medication you need to inject.
- Pull the syringe and needle out of the vial, remove the 18G needle and replace it with the chosen injection needle. Remove the cap.

### 3 - SELECT INJECTION SITE ###

### 4 - GIVE THE INJECTION ###

- Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab; let it dry.
- Insert the needle into the muscle, at a 90° angle, with on firm motion.
- Gently pull back the plunger to “draw”. If blood comes in the syringe, do not inject. Replace the needle and try again at a different site. If no not comes up, proceed to injection by steadily pushing the plunger. Wait for 10 seconds after everything has been pushed in.
- You may experience burning/pressure as you push in the medicine, especially with larger amounts.
- Remove the needle and syringe from the skin and dispose of them in the sharps container.
- Gently press the alcohol swab on the injection site, and use band aid is needed.

### TIPS TO REDUCE PAIN ###

- Never reuse needles
- Wait for the alcoolic solution you used to clean the injection spot to dry completely.
- Using a drawing needle and an injection needle keep the second one perfectly sharp for injection, and can reduce pain.
- Inject medicine at room temperature
- Don’t hesitate when pushing the needle through the skin: be firm, steady and quick.
- Insert the needle straight and avoid movement once inserted (moving back and forth, wiggling…)
