In order for estrogen to be efficient, the action of **testosterone MUST be blocked**, one way or the other. 

If **monotherapy** does not work for you, the solution lies in **anti-androgens**, or androgen blockers - sometimes only refered to as blockers.

Having an orchiectomy or vaginoplasty allows for stopping anti-androgens, but not estrogens. (It is in reallity a bit more complicated, and you can refer to the page on DHEA and intracrinology to know more about this issue.)

## Summary table of androgen blocking alternatives ##


|Name|Description|Risks|
|----|-----------|-----|
|‚úÖ Monotherapy|High dose estrogen without blockers - uses the negative feedback mechanism of the body|Low increase of thromboembolic events, especially with very high doses.|
|‚úÖ Bicalutamide|Very efficient testosterone blocker. Blocks the reception of T.|Low|
|‚úÖ GnRHA|‚ÄúPuberty blockers‚Äù, but can be used by transfem of any age to block the production of T|Low|
|üòê Spironolactone|Diuretic with an anti-androgen side-effect|Risks of hyperkalemia (excess of potassium, with variable risks)|
|üòê Progestogens (others than Androcur)|Very commonly prescribed anti-androgens. Work on the same basis as monotherapy, but with more side effects.|Risks of depression, hyperprolactinemia and liver failure|
|‚ùå Finasteride|Useful against ‚Äúmale pattern hair loss‚Äù, otherwise not very efficient|Risks of depression and neurological problems|
|‚ùå Dutasteride|Useful against ‚Äúmale pattern hair loss‚Äù, otherwise not very efficient|Risks of depression and neurological problems|
|‚ùå Androcur|Synthetic progestogen, officially unadvised by many countries|Risks of depression, meningioma (meninges tumor) and liver failure|
|‚ùå Flutamide|Obsolete medication (discontinued in Sweden)|High risks of liver failure.|



We can sort androgens blockers in 4 groups, according to their mode of actions:
- Androgen receptor blockers (Bicalutamide, Spironolactone)
- GnRH agonists and antagonists (also called Puberty blockers)
- Inhibitors of 5a-reductase (Finesteride, Dutasteride)
- Progestogens (among which Cyproterone Acetate or Androcur)
We will now go through all of them, group by group.
