However, if we were asked to propose an ideal treatment, this is our suggestion:

- Always consider starting with monotherapy, and see if you manage to sufficiently bring down your testosterone levels to 0.5 ng/ml (50 ng/dl). For routes of administration, we recommend transdermal gel or injections. With the gel, consider using the scrotal method to efficiently bring down your T - it can otherwise be difficult to have an efficient monotherapy. First, avoid it, and see with blood works if this works. The negative feedback (the mechanism of blocking T with E) starts at around 200 pg/ml. Consider staying between 200 and 600pg/ml of estradiol. If using injections, refer to the Transfemscience estimator as the dosage will differ depending on which ester you are using. As a reference, with Een (Estradiol Enanthate), a dosage of 10mg every week should be enough to stay between 550 and 650 pg/ml of estradiol - which is on the higher edge. Estradiol Valerate necessitates more frequent injections (every 4 days).

- If your T is not sufficiently brought down by E2 (i.e. it remains over 0.5ng/ml) , consider using a blocker. We recommend bicalutamide or leuprorelin/triptorelin. Keep in mind that it is not necessary and not recommended to bring down your T to absolute 0. Cis-women with typical hormonal balance have T (between 0,08 and 0,50 ng/ml), and it is necessary to maintain cognitive functions (memory…), among other functions. Staying anywhere under 0.5 ng/ml will not bring any masculinizing effects. Also keep in mind that bicalutamide will not lower your levels of T, only its effects. Your blood values will be the same.

- Add 100mg to 200mg progesterone after around 2 years of HRT (or reaching Tanner 3 in breast development)

- Use topical weak testosterone gel/cream if you want to maintain erectile function, or prevent penile pain and atrophy, and 6 months before SRS.
