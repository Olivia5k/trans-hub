However, if we were asked to propose an ideal treatment, this is our suggestion:

- Always consider starting with monotherapy, and see if you manage to sufficiently bring down your testosterone levels to 0.5 ng/ml (50 ng/dl). For routes of administration, we recommend **transdermal gel** or **injections**. With the gel, consider using the scrotal method to efficiently bring down your T - it can otherwise be difficult to have an efficient monotherapy. First, avoid it, and see with blood works if this works. The negative feedback (the mechanism of blocking T with E) starts at around 200 pg/ml. Consider staying between 200 and 600pg/ml of estradiol. If using injections, refer to the [Injectable Estradiol Simulator](https://transfemscience.org/misc/injectable-e2-simulator/) as the dosage will differ depending on which ester you are using. **Note however that this simulator is based on avarages, and your levels can greatly vary from the estimation. A blood test is always necessary to monitor your levels**. 

- If your testosterone is not sufficiently brought down by E2 (i.e. it remains over 0.5ng/ml), **consider using a blocker**. We recommend **bicalutamide** or **GnRHa** (leuprorelin/triptorelin). Keep in mind that it is not necessary and not recommended to bring down your T to absolute 0. Cis-women with typical hormonal balance have T (between 0,08 and 0,50 ng/ml), and it is necessary to maintain cognitive functions (memory…), among other functions. Staying anywhere under 0.5 ng/ml will not bring any masculinizing effects. Also keep in mind that bicalutamide will not lower your levels of T, only its effects. Your blood values will be the same.

- If you still notice masculinzing features - especially on the skin - Bicalutamide can make a difference by **preventing the androgenic effects the adrenal activity** (conversion of DHEA into androgens in the target cells of the skin - see the page on "Intracrinology")

- Add 100mg to 200mg **progesterone** after around 2 years of HRT (or reaching Tanner 3 in breast development), ideally taken in the rectum.

- Use topical weak testosterone gel/cream if you want to maintain erectile function, or prevent penile pain and atrophy, and 6 months before SRS.
