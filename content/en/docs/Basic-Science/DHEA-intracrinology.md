As we have explained, most of our sex hormones are produced in our gonads: ovaries and testes. That means that in case of surgical removal of the gonads (orchiectomy/vaginplasty, ovariectomy...), the vast majority (95%) of our sex hormones circulating in the body will be gone. 
This also means that after such surgery, transfem people on HRT could stop taking anti-androgens. However, does suppressing our gonad-produced sex hormones means the end of all masculinizing/feminizing effects of endogenous hormones?

Not exaclty. And this is where intracrinology and DHEA enters the game.

Intracrinology is a subfield of endocrinology developped in the 1980s. In the framwork of sex hormones, it is mostly based on the actifivty of DHEA. DHEA is a hormones massively produced in small glands situade right above the kidneys, called adrenal glands. They produced a bunch of other stuff (includind small amount of testosterone and estrogens directly). Intracrinlogy figured out that DHEA (that makes for the most present hormone in the body) travels to target cells (such as skin, hair follicules, prostate cells...) and are converted there, on the spot, by those very cells, into testosterone and DHT. That means that there is a peripheral production of androgens: not in the gonads, but direclty in the target cells. And what matters is the these androgen will actually direclty activate the androgen receptors
