  On the adrenal hormone DHEA, why it matters, and if tranfem people should stop taking blockers after SRS.

DHEA is the hormone found in largest quantity in the human body. It has a very weak masculinizing effet in itself, but its action is mostly due to its conversion into testosterone and DHT in and by target cells. Intracrinology is the subfield of endocrinology who looks at this phenomenon, and it can matter to us (mostly transfem people) for a number of reason.

As we have explained, most of our sex hormones are produced in our gonads: ovaries and testes. That means that in case of surgical removal of the gonads (orchiectomy/vaginplasty, ovariectomy...), the vast majority (95%) of our sex hormones circulating in the body will be gone. 
This also means that after such surgery, transfem people on HRT could stop taking anti-androgens. 

**However, does suppressing our gonad-produced sex hormones means the end of all masculinizing/feminizing effects of endogenous hormones?**

**Not exaclty. And this is where intracrinology and DHEA enters into the game.**

**Intracrinology** is a subfield of endocrinology developped in the 1980s. In the framwork of sex hormones, it is mostly based on the actifivty of **DHEA**. DHEA is a hormone massively produced in small gland situated right above the kidneys, called **adrenal gland**. They produced a bunch of other stuff (including small amount of testosterone and estrogens directly). 

Intracrinlogy figured out that DHEA (that makes for the most present hormone in the body) travels to target cells (such as skin, hair follicules, prostate cells...) and is converted there, **on the spot**, by those very cells, into testosterone and DHT. That means that there is a peripheral production of androgens: not in the gonads, but direclty in the target cells. And what matters is that these androgens will actually **direclty activate the androgen receptors in the target cells that has just produced them.** After that, they will be metabolized and realeased into the bloodstream **as something else**. Research has shown that surgical or chemical castration (i.e. by GnRHa) leads to a approxiamtely 50% drop of androgens in the target cells of the prostate. That is far from the 95% reduction observed in the bloodstream androgen levels. And this is likely to be true of skin cells, including hair follicule. 

Such research have been conducted in the framework of prostate cancer treatment. Indeed, one of the first thing to do to stop the cancer growth is to stop androgen exposition of the prostate. GnRHa are usually used to this intent, but this is were we realized that even after blocking 95% of bloodstream androgens (suppression of gonadal androgens), the prostate cells themselves still kept around 50% of their usual androgen levels. This led to the developpment of a combined treatment of GnRHa and androgen receptor blockers (bicalutamide) in order to block those 50% of adrogens left, coming from local conversion of DHEA. This combined treatment proved quite successfull. 

This means two things:

- After a gonad-removal surgery, a masculinzing activity is likely to continue, namely in the prostate (which is not much of an issue for transfem people if you don't have prostate cancer), but also in the skin and facial hair follicule (more anying for many transfem), since around only 50% of androgens acting on those cells will be gone. However, if you were not taking an androgen blocker of the **receptor blocker category** before surgery, this will not affect you much. Indeed, if before surgery you had manage to reduced your androgen levels either by monotherapy, or by another any other blockers than androgen receptors (biculutamide...), then your target cells were already affected by the local production of androgen from DHEA. 
- **The bloodtest values after surgery will not reflect the masculinzing activity happening from and in the cells**, since, as we said, the androgens localy produced from DHEA do not leave the cell into the bloodstream before being metabolized into something else. Your bloodtest results will most likely show near 0 androgen (not actual 0 - which you do not want anyway - since the adrenal gland also direclty produces androgens that is released into the bloodstream).

I speak here of "masculinizing activity", and of the consequences of DHEA activity for transfem people, because the conversion of DHEA in the skin cells goes only towards androgens. AFAB people will also sythetise androgen in their skin cells from DHEA. In other words, skin cells are only equipped, in every people, to locally sythetize androgens. The vaginal cells, however, will locally produce estrogens from DHEA.

It is commonly observed a **rise in andrenal activity in the few weeks following gonad-removing surgery**. DHEA is increased, which leads to masculinzing effects (acne, facial hair growth...) for AMAB people after orchiectomy/vaginoplasty.

**This data leads to reconsider the affirmation that an adrogen blocker is useless after surgery.** This is true of most androgen blockers that acts - direclty or not - on the levels of the gonads, that is by stopping the gonadal production of androgens. The gonads gone, there is indeed nothing left to block.

However, it makes the case for **continuation of androgen receptor blockers**, namely bicalutamide, which will be the only solution to block the masculinzing effects of the locally produced androgens, sythetized from DHEA. This is especially true if you were already taking bicalutamide before, without any problem. You could, however, consider lowering the doses.

This also suggests the superiority of bicalutamide (and recetor blockers) as an androgen blocker before surgery, since it is the only one who's able to block the masculinizing consequences of the adrenal activity.

**Finaly, note that you do not want to block the adrenal activity and reduce the production of DHEA, since DHEA is used in many other steroid conversions that are essential.**
