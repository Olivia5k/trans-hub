Growth hormone is not a sex hormone. It does, however, play a role in feminization/masculinization during HRT. This page is aiming at informing you about it, and proposing ways to naturally stimulates its production. **But it is also a strong warning not to try and take exogenous grownth hormones.**

A hormonal factor that is not often addressed is the role of growth hormones. As its name states, growth hormone is a key component in tissue growing and repair. It is released in a pulsatile way, and its average levels vary in stage of life. High during childhood and puberty, they decrease in our twenties. After that, their levels are dependent on the needs: spurts will occur after body traumas in order to stimulate healing. 
In the frame of medical transition, you could compare the role of growth hormones to the role of building workers when sex hormones are the architects. Sex hormones decide what and where to build, growth hormones do the actual building.  

The age-related factor explains why starting hormone therapy at younger age (before or in the early twenties) usually leads to faster and “better” development. 

{{< alert color="warning" title="Warning" >}}**This information, however, should not be read as an encouragement to find growth hormones online and start taking them. This is a very bad idea, for so many reasons. Not only does it constitute a serious health hazard, but if you’re taking it to enhance feminization, you might just reach the opposite effect, as exogenous growth hormones can cause a “thickening” of the face (nose, eyebrow, chin…)** {{< /alert >}}	

What you can do, however, is to aim at adopting a lifestyle that will naturally stimulate the production of growth hormones.
Such lifestyle includes:
- Relatively intense exercise (i.e. is “intense” an exercise the day after which you feel it in your muscles)
- Sleeping (avoid sleep deprivation, and as much sleep as possible)
- High protein intake (plant-based protein is protein too).
- Low sugar intake
