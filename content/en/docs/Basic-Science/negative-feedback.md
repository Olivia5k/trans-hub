   About the negative feedback mechanism, the centerpiece of HRT
---

{{% pageinfo %}}
The negative feedback mechanism is a normal and "natural" biological function of the endocrine system that regulates the production of sex hormones, so that we don't end up with too much or too little. Knowing about this mechanism is key to understanding many methods of HRT, and the way some medication work.

If the body naturally and continuously produces sex hormones, why don’t we end up with too much of them? Well, obviously because **the body is smart and able to self-regulate the production**. And understanding the way it does that can help us understand and choose better the ways of our medical transitions (at least for transfeminine people).

The production of sex hormones is the final step of a chain of signals and reactions that starts in the brain. A part of the brain (the hypothalamus) releases in a pulsatile way (i.e. in a regular temporal pattern) a hormone called **GnRH (Gonadotropin releasing hormone)**. GnRH is received by a gland in the lower part of the brain - the pituitary gland (or hypophysis), which, in response, releases two hormones called gonadotropins: **FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) and LH (Luteinizing hormone)**. Those two will go down to the gonads (ovaries and testes) which, in response, will produce testosterone (for the testes), and estradiol and progesterone (for the ovaries). 

This sex hormone production will continue, and the levels of estradiol/progesterone/testosterone will rise, and circulate in the body. They will be received by the brain, and after **reaching a threshold**, eventually send the signal to both hypothalamus and hypophysis to stop the production of both GnRH, and FSH/LH. In other words, when the sex hormones reach a level that the body judges to be correct, they turn into a messenger ordering to stop their own production. **This part of the circle is what we call negative feedback.** 

Now, what does this mean for us? It means that **we have a way to control the production of our sex hormones** - or at least to stop them. 
- On the one hand, the brain will respond indifferently to all androgens, estrogens and progestogens to activate the negative feedback. For the brain, they are all read as sex hormones. 
- On the other hand, the gonads can produce only one type of hormone, the one type whose production will be stopped by the negative feedback mechanism. That means that **by adding enough of any sex hormone in the bloodstream from the outside (this is called exogenous - from an outside source - as opposed to endogenous - body made), and even if it is not the hormone that your body produces naturally, you can stop the production of the only hormone your body can produce.**

So, in the case of feminizing HRT, we add exogenous estradiol; if the levels are high enough, the brain will receive the signal “ok, enough sex hormones” and send the signal to the gonads: “stop the production”. If you're AMAB, with testes, the only thing your body can do is to stop the production of testosterone. If you keep this level, you end up with the ideal hormonal balance for feminization. Your estradiol will be medium-high to high, your testosterone will be low, and so will be your LH/FSH.
Inversely, form AFAB people, taking testosterone will decrease your LH/FSH, and as a consequence, stop or significantly reduce your production of estradiol.

**Monotherapy**

This type of HRT - that is using only exogenous sex hormones to stop the production of endogenous sex hormones without using any “blockers” - is called **monotherapy**. You might wonder why this is the common treatment for transmasculine people (usually only taking testosterone), when practitioners are reluctant to prescribe monotherapy to trans women, and usually add androgen blockers with their sackful of side effects. This is mainly due to the fact that, in order to start the feedback mechanism that reduces testosterone, the levels of exogenous estradiol to reach are considered “high” by most practitioners (around 200pg/ml). 

As we said before, this is due to the fact that most research on estrogens effects concerns synthetic estrogens used in birth control. Those well-documented and observed side effects of synthetic estrogens are commonly used as the basis science to warn about all estrogens, ignoring (willfully or not?) the research distinguishing synthetic and bioavailable estrogens.
