We consider that, in the framework of healthcare and medical transition (mainly hormonal treatments), the harm done is twofold: 
First, the public healthcare providers tend to avoid any deviation from the standards of the Socialstyrelsen (now a more restricted guideline than the one of the WPATH). Those guidelines and standards are sometimes based on questionable research, and the practitioners blindly follow them, refusing to hear the claims and suggestions of their patients who are sometimes better informed, and equipped with newer, more relevant research. The recent limitations imposed on trans youth healthcare poses the serious ethical problem of denying treatments to many in order to “protect” a few. This leads to standard prescriptions that are too often inadequate if not dangerous: using blockers when monotherapy is usually sufficient, and when doing so, using the wrong (most risky) blockers, underdosing transfeminine patients in estrogens at the cost of their mental health, or leaving young transmasculine people on puberty blockers for too long without adding testosterone…
As a consequence of this too often inefficient if not dangerous healthcare, and along with the ever expanding waiting list to access any trans healthcare, the budget cuts on healthcare, and the too-often excessively pathologizing, psychiatrizing and invasive gate-keeping, trans people seeking HRT sometimes choose self-medication - or DIY - that is the self-administration of gender-affirming hormone therapy without approval or oversight from medical professionals. Those self-administered hormones are usually products bought online on gray-market. We do not see DIY HRT as a problem in itself (other than its cost) - and if we don’t promote it either - we simply must take into account that people do it, and that it should be the responsibility of public healthcare to reduce the risks associated with this practice. Since the public healthcare chose to disregard this issue, it is our responsibility - as trans peers, some of us using DIY HRT - to share the relevant information to reduce harm.

This is why our action to respond to this situation is twofold itself: on the one hand, propose trustworthy knowledge and resource on all available treatments so that people can be able to judge by themselves the prescription given by their practitioner and try to open a space of discussion in order to be heard on what they would like to be prescribed; and on the other hand, provide resource and safe supplies for people choosing self-medication.
