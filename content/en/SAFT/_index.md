Transhub is a grass-root, volunteer-run organization, working with **therapeutic education** and **harm reduction**, in the framework of medical transitions. 

Our main and first campaign consists in a ressources and information repository for medical transitions, which you will find in the _Documentation_ tab.

However, we also work on **expending the notion of "harm reduction" beyond the stricly medical sphere** of our trans lives. 

## Structurally, **being trans also means being exposed a number of social risks**, and TransHub is working to take these into consideration in its harm reduction framework. ##

The **SAFT** - a solidarity fund for transgender people in Sweden - is here to answer this need.

**With this fund, we envision a number of ways to extend our activities. Among those are:**

- Provide, on demand, safe medical supplies for injections, for anyone self-medicating. This includes syringes with needles, and alcohol wipes, suitable to both intramuscular and subcutaneous injections.
 
- Healthcare fund: to (possibly partially) cover punctual costs of medical transition (such as blood test, injections supplies, visit to practitioners…), for the most precarious of us.

- Organizing the practical parts of TransHub's harm reduction endeavor, such as hormones self-injection workshop.

- Social Emergency fund: for emerceny needs, such as food, hygienic, transport, rent...

- Emergency shelter: for those of us losing accomodation, proposing short housing in a hotel or at a volunteer host.

- Propose free or pay-as-you-will mental health counseling with a team of queer psychologists (or psychology students), trained to trans related issues and questioning. 
 
- Buying a professional laser hair removal machine to propose free (or pay-as-you-will) safe hair removal sessions for trans folks who need it. This has been successfully done by several trans collectives in the world - let's keep our hopes up!

**We use the term Trans in its broadest sense, as an umbrella term encompassing transsexual, transgender, genderqueer, non binary, gender non conforming, intersex and, more generally, any person whose gender identity or gender expression is non-conforming and/or different from the sex assigned at birth.*
