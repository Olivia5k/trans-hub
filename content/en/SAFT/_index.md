# **SAFT - Social Action Fund för Transpersoner** #

{{% /blocks/lead %}}

{{% blocks/lead color="primary" %}}

Transhub is a grass-root, volunteer-run organization, working with **therapeutic education** and **harm reduction**, in the framework of medical transitions. 

Our aim is to inform the trans community of their healthcare alternatives, following the therapeutic education idea that people need to **reappropriate the means of their healthcare.** 

We believe that precise and well-sourced knowledge on all possible treatments is key to **seize back the means of our medical transition, and to reduce harm.**

Our main and first campaign consists in a ressources and information repository for medical transitions, which you will find in the _Documentation_ tab.

However, we also work on **expending the notion of "harm reduction" beyond the stricly medical sphere** of our trans lives. 

## Structurally, **being trans also means being exposed a number of social risks**, and TFSF is working to take these into consideration in its harm reduction framework. ##

The main project for our future is to operate a **solidarity fund** for transgender people in Sweden.

**With this fund, we envision a number of ways to extend our activities. Among those are:**

- Provide, on demand, safe medical supplies for injections, for anyone self-medicating. This includes syringes with needles, and alcohol wipes, suitable to both intramuscular and subcutaneous injections.
 
- Healthcare fund: to (possibly partially) cover punctual costs of medical transition (such as blood test, injections supplies, visit to practitioners…), for the most precarious of us.

- Organizing the practical parts of TransHub's harm reduction endeavor, such as hormones self-injection workshop.

- Social Emergency fund: for emerceny needs, such as food, hygienic, transport, rent...

- Emergency shelter: for those of us losing accomodation, proposing short housing in a hotel or at a volunteer host.

- Propose free or pay-as-you-will mental health counseling with a team of queer psychologists (or psychology students), trained to trans related issues and questioning. 
 
- Buying a professional laser hair removal machine to propose free (or pay-as-you-will) safe hair removal sessions for trans folks who need it. This has been successfully done by several trans collectives in the world - let's keep our hopes up!
