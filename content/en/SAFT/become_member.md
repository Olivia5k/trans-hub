### What is the SAFT?###

SAFT stands for **Solidarity and Action Fund for Transpeople**. It is a mutual aid fund designed with both short terms and long terms goals.
In short terms, the SAFT can be requested by members of the community in need of financial aid covering costs of life such as : housing (including electricity…), food, medical costs, communication costs (phone, Internet…), transport (Public city transportation), and other costs of life.
On the longer term, the fund is to become the centerpiece of a **near-comprehensive healthcare system build by transpeople, for transpeople**. 
You can also think of the SAFT as a “kassa” of a union. TransHub aims to be a social union for transpeople and the SAFT will work as its mutual aid fund.

### Why should I become a member of the SAFT? ###

Because it is a great way to **support our siblings, or show support as an ally**. You can contribute to a very concrete and ambitious project, that turns into a material difference for people who needs it. It is a low efforts involvment that can make a big difference. 

**And because we need each other to build the care system that we need and dream of.**

### Who can be a member?###

**Anyone**. We think that cis-money is money too, and we gladly take it. When you sign up to become a member, you specificy if you become a **beneficiary member** - which means that you identify as trans/NB and might one day want to ask for help from the SAFT -  and as an ally you can become a **supportive members**. 

Only beneficiary members can attend the SAFT’s annual assembly where they can vote over decisions regarding the fund’s governance. 

### How much is the membership fee and how do I pay?###

**You pay what you can**. We give suggestion on our donation platform, from 50kr a month to 400kr. You can give more, and you can give less: **from each according to their abilities.** 
You can pay with **card** through our donation platform on ActionNetwork, by **bank transfer, bankgirot, or cash.** 
Anyone can also do a punctual donation, but you do not become a member.

We would prefer that you use the donation platform or - if you use bank transfer, that you set up an automatic recurring transfer. Write to us if you want to pay by cash.

### How can I request help from the SAFT? ###

Write an email to us with detail regarding your needs: reason, amounts… Describe a bit who you are and your situation. In most cases we need to get an invoice for what you need to pay. For legal reasons, we cannot simply “give” you money to cover already paid expenses; we can only pay a bill for you. 

We will come back to you as soon as possible, and maybe set up a meeting (digital if needs be), but keep in mind that we are a small team of volunteer, so it might take us some time to process your request.
