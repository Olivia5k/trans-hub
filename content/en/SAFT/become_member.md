**TransHub aims at becoming a fighting social union for transpeople in Sweden. By becoming a member, you can take part in building this solidarity network, and ask for aid from the SAFT, or show support as an ally.**

As by the rules of non-profit organization, **membership is open to all**. However, we distinguish three types of memberships for the fuctionning of the organization

**- Active membership:** active members are part of the trans* community. They are active in the organization by participating to regular meetings, included but not limited to the annual meeting, and other activities organized such as fundraisers, workshopsâ€¦ Membership fees are determined according to income. Active member can also ask for aid from the SAFT

**- Beneficiary membership:** beneficiary members are individuals who identify as trans* and want to contribute to the solidarity fund and/or be able to receive aid from the SAFT if need be, but do not want to be active in the organisation. On the unions model, membership fees are determined according to income

**- Supportive membership:** supportive membership are open to all allies who wish to contribute to the solidarity fund. They cannot, of course, ask for aid from the SAFT. Monthly donation amount is chosen by the member when starting the membership.

**- Ponctual donation:** ponctual donations are also always welcomed
